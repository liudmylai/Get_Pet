## Workshop Project - Get-a-Pet
There are many pets in and around your area that need some love. **Let's help them find a new home**

### Project Details
- Must have at least three pages, one of which should be a contact page or feedback page that uses a form 
- Create a wireframe outlining the look and feel of your website (can use wireframe.cc or app.diagrams.net to make it digital)
- Design your website using a CSS Grid or FlexBox layout or a combination of both.
- Make it as responsive as possible by adding media queries to complement your CSS  layout
- Use the fetch method to make an asynchronous call to a third-party API. This API should be related to your project in some way
- Use the data you get back to add content to your web pages with what you've learned in JavaScript
- Add your personal touch or style to the CSS
